# detail description of this dictionary
desc = '''
The Collins English Dictionary is a printed and online dictionary of English. It is published by
HarperCollins in Glasgow.

The edition of the dictionary in 1979 with Patrick Hanks as editor and Laurence Urdang as editorial
director, was the first British English dictionary to be typeset from the output from a computer
database in a specified format. This meant that every aspect of an entry was handled by a different
editor using different forms or templates. Once all the entries for an entry had been assembled,
they were passed on to be keyed into the slowly assembled dictionary database which was
completed for the typesetting of the first edition.
